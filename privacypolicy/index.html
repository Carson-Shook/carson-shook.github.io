                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>This privacy policy (known herein as "this document") is an agreement between you (known herein as "the user", "you", or "yourself") and carsonshook.com or any of its subdomains (known herein as "the website" or "this website") as well as an agreement to use any applications, utilities, or resources found on this website. By continuing to use this website, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions laid out in this document. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions laid out in this document, please cease use of this website or any of its contents that you find disagreeable. This document also outlines the terms and conditions of direct communication with Carson Shook (known herein as "the owner"). If you would like to scrub all data related to yourself, please see the section below, titled "Your Data Rights," for instructions. The contents of this agreement are subject to change in the future, and if possible you will be notified when they do either directly, or passively through Twitter if you follow the owner at the account listed in the footer of this website.</p>
                <h3>The Website (carsonshook.com)</h3>
                <p>This website makes no absolute guarantees of privacy, but does its best to ensure that little to no data is collected about the user. The website makes use of several third parties to supply the services found within, most notably GitHub, on which the site is hosted, and GitHub may make use of user tracking (such as IP address or other info) not explicitly stated in this document. This website also makes use of Cloudflare, which may track and store IP address or other info. This website does not purposefully store cookies or session data about the user, except as required by third party services (such as Disqus for the comment system on this website's blog). No other part of the website makes use of the user's data, and thus no other data is collected, and none of the previously stated data is stored by the owner of this website. Any embedded resources or outgoing links (such as those in the footer or contained in blog posts) are not governed by this document and adhere to the privacy policies found on the websites embedded/linked to. This website does not make use of advertisements. In the unlikely event of a databreach, any users on which the website keeps data will be notified as soon as possible following the owner becoming aware of a breach.</p>
                <h3>Projects and Resources</h3>
                <p>The projects and resources available on this website do their best to avoid data collection, and in fact, the majority only ever live locally on your machine. The data they produce belongs to you and is not shared with third parties. That said, the following projects make no guarantees to privacy as they are designed to store data or work with third parties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BetterPonymotes for Safari may share usage statistics with the original developer (This may not be true now that APNG is a native browser format and no longer requires loading converted GIFs from the original developer's servers), and it is used in conjunction with reddit, another third party service that comes with its own privacy policy/data usage conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you do not agree to the terms of any of the above applications/services/resources, do not install any of the software whose terms you disagree with, and cease using any software or resources whose terms you find disagreeable. If you would like data associated with any of the above services removed, please see the section below, titled "Your Data Rights," for instructions.</p>
                <h3>Direct Communications</h3>
                <p>By contacting the owner of this website over email or other services, you consent to receiving future contact from the owner or one of their partners (such as developers also working on projects related to your enquiry). If contact is made over email, IRC, or some other form of communication that allows the owner to save a record of your correspondence, then the information may be retained indefinitely (or until no longer necessary) unless a data deletion request is made. The owner makes no guarantees as to the length of retention of these kinds of data. If contact is made over services such as GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., then the correspondence you make is within your control to delete, up to the extent that is allowed by said third party services. You may need to contact the respective services in order to remove record of correspondence. The owner reserves the right to retain any work done or completed products produced as a result of correspondence for portfolio purposes, given that a prior arrangement has not been made at the time the work was created and that the work does not contain personal information that would require its deletion in accordance with Your Data Rights as outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
                <h3>Third Parties</h3>
                <p>This website and the projects and resources found within may make use of third party services to facilitate some functionality. The owner of this website may have access to this data up to the extent that is allowed by each service under their terms of service documents and privacy policies.

                        <br>
                        Used to reduce impact of traffic as well as to secure the website with a certificate.

                        Used to serve the font "Raleway" (weights 200, 300, and 600) across all parts of the site. According to the FAQ page of the Google Fonts API, "Requests for CSS assets are cached for 1 day," and "The font files themselves are cached for one year." While the owner supposedly has access to view these requests in an analytics dashboard, the page currently redirects to the Google Fonts API homepage, thus making said data inaccessible.
