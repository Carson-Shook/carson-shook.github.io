				<p>As you have probably guessed by the name of this site, I'm Carson Shook. I'm a software developer.</p>
                <p>If you were expecting something more here, then you should have seen it before I was hired. Basically this site is just a simple place for me to host some projects through GitHub. I barely have time to update the blog (and I don't often have much of anything interesting to say anyway), but you will usually find that I'm working on something.</p>
