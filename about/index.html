				<p>As you have probably guessed by the name of this site, I'm Carson Shook. I'm a recent graduate of <a href="http://www.ecok.edu/" title="East Central University">East Central University</a> with a Computer Science degree. While attending, I served as President for the local gaming club, and I also regularly attended the CS department's club meetings.</p>
                <p>I currently work with my father's <a href="http://www.lasersquadron.com/" title="Laser Squadron">laser tag business</a>, for which I work as the web administrator, as well as a referee.</p>
                <p>I do a lot of tinkering that isn't really worthy of being published, as well as ensureing smooth sailing on my family's home network. I enjoy developing software, and while I don't have many publicly available projects, I'm working hard to change that.</p>
                <p>I'm currently seeking a software development position in the Tulsa area. I am skillfull with C, Java, Perl, and Python, and quite adept at web design utilizing HTML5 and CSS3 standards, plus I've played around with JavaScript here and there. I am also somewhat familier with .NET, SharePoint, MicrosoftSQL, Apache, Jekyll, and other platforms, and I'm quick when it comes to learning new things. If you have a position within any of those lines of work that needs to be filled, you can connect with me by clicking one of the links at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, if you just want to see what I'm up to on the internet, you can click the same links, since that's mostly what I do with my free time anyway.</p>
