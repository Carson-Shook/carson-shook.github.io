				<p>As you have probably guessed by the name of this site, I'm Carson Shook. I'm currently a Student at <a href="http://www.ecok.edu/" title="East Central University">East Central University</a>, and I'm majoring in computer science. I'm currently serving as President for the local gaming club, and I also regularly attend the CS department's club meetings.</p>
                <p>I currently hold two jobs, the first of which is my father's <a href="http://www.lasersquadron.com/" title="Laser Squadron">laser tag business</a>, for which I work as the web administrator, as well as a referee on weekends that I return home. The second job that hold is as a lab assistant for the computer science department.</p>
                <p>I do a lot of tinkering that isn't really worthy of being published, as well as ensureing smooth sailing on my family's home network. I enjoy developing software, and while I don't have many publicly available projects, I'm working hard to change that.</p>
                <p>I'm currently seeking a software development position in the Tulsa area to work at following my graduation in May. I am skillfull with C, Java, Perl, and Python, and quite adept at web design utilizing HTML5 and CSS3 standards. I am also somewhat familier with .NET, SharePoint, MicrosoftSQL, Apache, Jekyll, and other platforms, and I'm quick and determined when it comes to learning new things. If you have a position within any of those lines of work that needs to be filled, you can connect with me by clicking one of the links at the bottom of the screen. Alternatively, if you just want to see what I'm up to on the internet, you can click the same links, since that's what I do with my free time.</p>
