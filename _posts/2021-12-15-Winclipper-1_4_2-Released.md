This release of Winclipper includes the following bug fixes:
- Fixed an issue with checkbox labels getting cut off at the end in Settings.
- Added checks to make sure the control key has its state properly restored if the user is holding it down while selecting a clip (thanks [micjoh](https://github.com/micjoh) for giving me a way to reproduce the "phantom V issue"!).
