It arrived! While there is still no word from Apple on the developer program (though I suspect that they will comment on it soon enough. The developer backlash is pretty huge). I am happy to get my Apple Watch though, and while the photos didn't turn out quite like how I was hoping they would (home renovations, so  stuff is being moved around and the good lighting isn't really an option), I hope you find the box contents interesting.

One interesting thing was that the box was really heavy, more than one would expect. Most of the weight seems to be in the actual watch-box itself. It's nice though, and the felt interior will make a perfect place to set my watch at night. As for the clarity, it's absolutely stunning!
