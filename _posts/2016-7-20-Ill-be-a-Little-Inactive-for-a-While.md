I'm currently the Dungeon Master for a D&D 5e campaign (Hoard of the Dragon Queen), and it's taking up a fair amount of my time since I'm still getting used to being a DM. I do plan on getting back to software development whenever I get things a bit more organized. This past weekend included attending Tokyo in Tulsa, running our first campaign session, and taking my car into the dealership. And all of this while I'm playing PokémonGO. If only there were ~~more~~ any Pokéstops out here in the sticks...

Anyway, I will get back to this eventually, but I'm basically just having a lot of fun with friends at the moment, and who knows how long our schedules will all work out. So I'm taking advantage of this time while I have it.
