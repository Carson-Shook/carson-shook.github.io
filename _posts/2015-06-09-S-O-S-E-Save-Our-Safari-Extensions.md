Just a day after praising Apple for all of the things that they are doing with OS X, iOS, and Watch OS, I'm now quite miffed at them for what they announced just today. Now as you may remember, there used to be separate developer programs for each of the different Apple products available, but yesterday they announced the consolidation of those programs. What they neglected to mention until the email that I received today was that the Safari Developer program will be lumped in too.

Digging deeper, I won't be able to update BPM after the July cut-off date. I can't submit it to the Extension Store (or whatever they choose to call it) because it contains a butt-load of trademarked content. So if the twelve or so of you want to keep using BPM on Safari, please go [leave feedback](http://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html) on Apple's website. If that's not enough motivation for you because you don't like ponies, /u/honestbleeps Reddit Enhancement Suite is in the same boat. If you or a friend use Safari, please spread the word if you want to keep extensions free for everyone.

Thanks,
