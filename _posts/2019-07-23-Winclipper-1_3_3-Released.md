This release of Winclipper includes the following improvements and bug fixes:
- Winclipper will now check to see whether or not it is already running, and will not open again if it's already running.
- If Windows Explorer crashes or is restarted, Winclipper will now add its notification icon back to the system tray.
- Fixed a nasty crash that occurred in some situations when Direct2D didn't clean itself up properly.
- Added additional safety when attempting to write a file.
