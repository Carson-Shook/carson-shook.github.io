It's been a fun journey to get here, and now it's time to officially christen this ship as it sets sail for public consumption. Cursed-Breakout is now officially released in its shiny version 1.0 form. When I started this project, I didn't think that I'd actually go this far with it, but here we are now. The only thing left to do is to create a project page for it on my site, and then I'll get started on whatever the next thing is that I might do.

As always, you can read all about these changes in the changelog down below or on its [GitHub repository](http://github.com/Carson-Shook/cursed-breakout).
