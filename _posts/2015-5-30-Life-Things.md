Hello everyone! It's been a little while since I've posted, but I finally have a free weekend, so I figured that today was a perfect day for writing. Over the past couple of weeks, a lot of things have happened to me. One, I graduated from ECU (still waiting on them to send me my physical diploma), two, I went in for a job interview (my first *real* one), three, I got the job (I'm now a junior developer for Saltus Technologies), and four, I completed my first week on the job!

So first, a little plug for the company. [Saltus Technologies](http://www.saltustechnologies.com) is an electronic ticketing system for police officers that is custom tailored to each department's needs. It's easy to use, and it automates the process of exporting tickets into whatever format the county clerk needs it to be in. If you know any police departments that are looking to move to a better system that paper tickets, point them in our direction.

As for what I've been doing outside of all that, the answer is: not much. I've been a bit swamped by how quickly everything's been happening. I still have time to keep up with BPM though, so don't worry about that. Also, my parents were nice enough to buy me an Apple Watch to commemorate my graduation. I'll be sure to do an unboxing and demonstration when it comes in. Some time after that, I'm sure that I'll try making some kind of app for it not long after that to get a feel for how it's different from iPhone.

Anyway, hopefully I'll find something to talk about soon.
