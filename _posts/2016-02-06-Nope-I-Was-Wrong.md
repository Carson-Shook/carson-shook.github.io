Turns out the certificate that I got was not what I thought it was. My certificate is still set to expire in March. I'll be honest, I do not understand certificates one bit. I understand what they *do*, but I have no idea how they work and what's what. If anyone out there has a concise explanation of how code signing works, and how different types of certs (root, intermediate, etc.) work, please let me know in the comments. Looks like I will have to drop $99 to update BPM after all.

Ah well. It's not a big deal. Who knows, maybe I'll submit an iPhone app in the process. Maybe I'll even learn how to use Swift (which is open source now days).

So, much like Blinkin from *Robin Hood: Men in Tights*, I briefly though that I could see, only to realize that I was wrong the moment that i ran headfirst into a tree trunk.
