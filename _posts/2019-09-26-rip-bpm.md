Well, I guess now that Safari 13 is out, BPM is officially dead on Safari. It had a good run. It almost made it to the end of the show itself. It's hard to think that the show has been around for nearly 10 years, and BPM has been around nearly as long, and living in many different incarnations.

So I guess this is kind of a toast to BPM for Safari. Thanks for being the first open source project I ever contributed to. Thanks to /u/Typhos for giving me the chance to be a part of the  team (or whatever you call our loose collective. Many secret pony threads were enjoyed because of you.

Thanks for the memories. üêé
