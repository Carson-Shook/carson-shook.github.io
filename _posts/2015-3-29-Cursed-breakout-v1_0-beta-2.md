title: Cursed-Breakout v1.0 Beta 2
published: true

Here's a new beta version to test. Now you don't have to specify the file as an argument (though you still can if you want to) because this version ships with a title screen that contains a file selection menu. There is also a new debug feature that will be great for level makes: press `s` to skip a level. This way you can ensure that everything is laid out the way that is supposed to be.

This will probably be the final beta unless any significant bugs are discovered between now and whenever I decided to push it out.

As always, you can read all about these changes in the changelog down below or on its [GitHub repository](http://github.com/Carson-Shook/cursed-breakout).
